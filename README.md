### Project Overview - 
     This project uses real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and applies Machine Learning to predict future temperatures. 
     By combining real-time data fetching, preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and interactive visualization, this project offers a complete end-to-end weather forecasting pipeline — all in Python.

### Key Features & Technologies - 
    🔄 Real-time Weather Data Collection
    Fetches 5-day weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API.
    🧹 Data Preprocessing
    Cleans, fills missing values, and prepares data for modeling using pandas.
    🧠 Machine Learning Model
    Trains a Random Forest Regressor to predict temperature from various weather features.
    📈 Data Visualization
    Uses Matplotlib for plotting actual vs predicted temperatures and trends of other weather features.

  ### 🛠️ Setup Instructions- 
    Follow these steps to run the project in Google Colab:
    1)Open the project notebook in Colab.
    2)Run all cells — no setup needed.
    3)You’ll see outputs, visualizations, and even interactive widgets!
